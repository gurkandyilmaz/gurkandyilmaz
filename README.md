## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Gurkan.

My main interests are Machine Learning/Deep Learning and their applications in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.<br /><br />

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms.<br /><br />

Some of the works i have done:

- I have worked with **Python**, built a web application [ML-Web](https://github.com/gurkandyilmaz/ml-website) that hosts trained machine learning models. I had used **Django**, **Scikit-learn**, **Numpy**.
- In another side project, I built a web application [Turkish Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/gurkandyilmaz/sentiment) by using **Flask**, **Tensorflow 2**, and **Keras**.

- I have also been working with **C/C++** to study the Data structures and Algorithms.<br /><br />
