## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am GÃ¼rkan.

My main interests are **Machine Learning/Deep Learning** and their applications in **Natural Language Processing**, **Recommendation Systems** and Computer Vision (in the near future).<br /><br />

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently participating in Data Science Bootcamps and kaggle competitions.<br /><br />

Some of the works I have done:

- I have worked with **Python**, built a web application [ML-Web](https://github.com/gurkandyilmaz/ml-website) that hosts trained machine learning models. I had used **Django**, **Scikit-learn**, **Numpy**. It can be seen at [OriginAI](http://originai.herokuapp.com/)
- In another side project, I built a web application [Turkish Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/gurkandyilmaz/sentiment) by using **Flask**, **Tensorflow**, and **Keras**.
- Yet in another side project, I built another web application [Character Based Language Generation](https://github.com/gurkandyilmaz/language_generation) that generates a text based on the trained model in a character level. **Tensorflow** and **Keras** were used.
- And lastly, I made a data visualization app [Data Visualization](https://github.com/gurkandyilmaz/data_visualization) with again **Flask**. It is inspired from pandas profiling library but it is a way simpler version.
